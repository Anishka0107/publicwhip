After a policy is created you will be able to associate it with  divisions and select how a supporter of the policy would have voted. <%= inline_project_name %> compares the real votes of MPs to your selections and calculates the voting record for the policy.

Remember, all policies are public. They are a shared resource to be edited and updated by anyone (like Wikipedia).
