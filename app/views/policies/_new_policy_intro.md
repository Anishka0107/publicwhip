Add a new policy by completing two statements below.

After a policy is created you will be able to associate it with  divisions and select how a supporter of the policy would have voted. The Public Whip compares the real votes of MPs to your selections and calculates the voting record for the policy. [Find out more about the process](/help/faq#policies).

Remember, all policies are public. They are a shared resource to be edited and update by anyone (like Wikipedia).

## Tips for useful policies

* **Allow for as little interpretation as possible.** For example, "Evangelical Christian" and "Fiscal Responsibility" are not policies since there are differing opinions about what would be implemented. Instead, things like "Ban research using embryos" and "Buy more nuclear weapons" are policies because, even if you don't agree with them, you can still agree on which way they would vote.

* **Be specific.** Usually a policy can't be broken down into other policies. If it can be, maybe you should split it into two sub-policies. There are exceptions, for example "Pro-vegetarianism" may agree with all the votes for "Conserve coastal fish stocks" although for quite different reasons.

* **Don’t duplicate.** Check the [policies page](/policies) to see if the policy you are thinking of exists. The opposite of a policy is not necessarily a policy. For example “For maintaining a price on carbon” and “For removing a price on carbon” are practically will probably produce inverted results and so have limited new value for people viewing the site.

* **Check whether relevant divisions exist.** All policies should have existing divisions that relate to them. For example, "Make Australia a Republic" doesn't work well as a policy because there haven't been relevant divisions since our records begin (2006).

* **Don't be shy**. These policies belong to everyone. If you believe that a policy is wrongly voting on divisions or is ill-defined, fix it.
