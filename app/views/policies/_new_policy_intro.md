Add a new policy by completing two statements below.

After a policy is created you will be able to associate it with  divisions and select how a supporter of the policy would have voted. The Public Whip compares the real votes of MPs to your selections and calculates the voting record for the policy. [Find out more about the process](/help/faq#policies).

Remember, all policies are public. They are a shared resource to be edited and update by anyone (like Wikipedia).

## Tips for useful policies

* **Allow for as little interpretation as possible**. *“For healthy children”* is a bad example because it is a matter of opinion how a specific divisions relates to it. We could argue all day about it. *“For increasing funding to university education”* is a good example because it is easier to know how a supporter would have voted in relevant divisions.

* **Be specific.** Usually a policy can't be broken down into other policies. If it can be, maybe you should split it into two sub-policies. There are exceptions, for example "Pro-vegetarianism" may agree with all the votes for "Conserve coastal fish stocks" although for quite different reasons.

* **Don’t duplicate.** Check the [policies page](/policies) to see if the policy you are thinking of exists. The opposite of a policy is not necessarily a policy. For example “For maintaining a price on carbon” and “For removing a price on carbon” are practically will probably produce inverted results and so have limited new value for people viewing the site.

* **Check whether relevant divisions exist.** All policies should have existing divisions that relate to them. For example, "Make Australia a Republic" doesn't work well as a policy because there haven't been relevant divisions since our records begin (2006).

* **Don't be shy**. These policies belong to everyone. If you believe that a policy is wrongly voting on divisions or is ill-defined, fix it.
