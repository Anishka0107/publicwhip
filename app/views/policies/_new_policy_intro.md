Add a new policy by completing two statements below.

After a policy is created you will be able to associate it with  divisions and select how a supporter of the policy would have voted. The Public Whip compares the real votes of MPs to your selections and calculates the voting record for the policy. [Find out more about the process](/help/faq#policies).

Remember, all policies are public. They are a shared resource to be edited and update by anyone (like Wikipedia).

## Tips for useful policies

* Policies should be open to as little interpretation as possible. For example, "Evangelical Christian" and "Fiscal Responsibility" are not policies since there are differing opinions about what would be implemented. Instead, things like "Ban research using embryos" and "Buy more nuclear weapons" are policies because, even if you don't agree with them, you can still agree on which way they would vote.

* Usually a policy can't be broken down into other policies. If it can be, maybe you should split it into two sub-policies. There are exceptions, for example "Pro-vegetarianism" may agree with all the votes for "Conserve coastal fish stocks" although for quite different reasons.

* The opposite of a policy is not necessarily a policy, particularly if it is not one of the extremes. There could be, for instance, three different approaches to solving a particular problem.

* All policies must be convertable into votes. So, for example, "Make Australia a Republic" doesn't work because there haven't been any such votes (recently).

* Don't be shy. These policies belong to everyone. If you believe that a policy is wrongly voting on divisions or is ill-defined, fix it.
