In Australia, every 4 years or so, we all head to the polling booths across the country to elect individuals to represent us in Federal Parliament. They become Australia’s [Members of Parliament](/members), and they’re there to advocate for the interests of the people who live in their electorate (whether we voted for them or not), vote on our behalf, and ultimately pass legislation to create the society we want, one which works for us.

But how do you know that the individual speaking for you in your electorate votes in your interest, or even bothers to turn up at all. Have they ever, even once, voted against their party on an issue people like you in your electorate care about?

Here at the Public Whip we make it easier for you to see exactly how your MP voted.

We’ve peeled back the layers of stuffy jargon, arcane procedures and Monty Python-esque language so you can find out whether a member voted on [expanding powers to intercept communications](/policies/44) or for [Aboriginal land rights](/policies/24). There is a whole [list of policies](/policies). If you see one missing, you can add your own.

It’s easy to [get started by searching](/search) or head to the full list of [Representatives](/members/representatives) and  [Senators](/members/senate).

Public Whip was built by the [OpenAustralia Foundation](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au), an independent, non-partisan not-for-profit. It is based on the ground-breaking [UK Public Whip site](http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/) originally created by
[Francis Irving](http://www.flourish.org/) and [Julian Todd](http://www.goatchurch.org.uk/) in 2003. We owe Julian and Francis a massive debt of gratitude for everything they've done.

A huge thank you to [Google Australia](http://www.google.com.au) whose donation made the development of this Public Whip possible.

The Australian Public Whip was created by Henare Degan, Matthew Landauer, Luke Bacon and Katherine Szuminska. Political research for the research and writing of policies was done by the magnificent Micaela Ash and Natasha Burrows.
