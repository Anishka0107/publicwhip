# About Working Title

In Australia we elect individuals to represent us in Parliament. These people, our Members of Parliament, are then supposed to vote in our interest and pass legislation to create the society we want. Our media gives enormous space to these members to talk about and sell their positions—but do you know how the individual speaking for your electorate actually votes? Do they ever cross the floor to vote against their party for the interests and beliefs of people in your electorate?

This website, Public Whip, creates a simple record of how every member of Federal Parliament votes in every recorded division (“Division” is the fancy parliamentary term for <em>vote in parliament</em>). Looking for the member who represents you? It’s easy to [get started by searching](/search) or head to the full list of [Senators](/members/senate) and [Representatives](/members/representatives).

A lot of what happens in parliament is pretty confusing and full of stuffy jargon. People like you are using Public Whip to discuss and summarise many of the divisions and explain how they are related to specific policy positions. That means that you don’t have to speak archaic, parliamentary language to understand if a member votes for [expanding powers to intercept communications](/policies/44) or for [Aboriginal land rights](/policies/24) as an example. There is a whole [list of policies](/policies), which you could even add to.
