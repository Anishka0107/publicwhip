The short answer is: we didn’t. A person’s stance on a [Policy](#policies) is determined by how they voted in parliament in [Divisions](#division) that relate to that Policy. In other words - it doesn’t matter what they say, it’s what they do that counts.

However we might not have the full picture and you can help fix that. Here’s how it works:

After [creating a Policy](/policies/new) on <%= inline_project_name %>, we need to find [Divisions](/divisions) that relate to that [Policy](/policies) and work out how someone who supported the Policy would have voted. Once a Division has been added to a Policy, <%= inline_project_name %> uses each person’s vote to calculate a Policy agreement percentage - you can easily see these details by selecting a person on the Policy’s page.

There are thousands of Divisions on <%= inline_project_name %> so there’s bound to be some that have not yet been added to a particular Policy. You can help improve the accuracy of <%= inline_project_name %> by finding and classifing more Divisions for the Policies you care about.
