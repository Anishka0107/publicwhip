  The Public Whipâ€™s voting and membership data extends back to

  %b Numerics:
  The database contains
  %strong= number_with_delimiter(Member.select(:person_id).distinct.count)
  distinct Representatives and Senators from
  %strong= number_with_delimiter(Member.select(:party).distinct.count)
  parties who have voted across
  %strong= number_with_delimiter(Division.count)
  divisions. In total
  %strong= number_with_delimiter(Vote.count)
  votes were cast giving an average of
  -# Doing this to make it match the php app as a quick hack
  - if Vote.count.to_f / Division.count == 1.0
    %strong 1
  - else
    %strong= number_with_precision (Vote.count.to_f / Division.count), precision: 1, strip_insignificant_zeros: true
  per division. Of these
  %strong= number_with_delimiter(Member.joins(:member_info).sum(:rebellions).to_i)
  were against the majority vote for their party giving an average rebellion rate of
  <strong>#{Member.joins(:member_info).sum(:rebellions) == 0 ? "0%" : "#{number_with_precision((Member.joins(:member_info).sum(:rebellions).to_f / Vote.count.to_f * 100), precision: 2, strip_insignificant_zeros: true)}%"}</strong>.
