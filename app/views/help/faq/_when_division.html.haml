%p
  Most decisions in Parliament are made
  %a{:href => "http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/voting-in-the-chambers.html"}
    ‘on
    the voices’
  and not by division. When a question is asked by
  the Chair, the Members of Parliament (MPs) or Senators call out Aye
  (yes) or No and the Chair decides which are in the majority without
  recording the names of who voted and how they voted.
%p
  A division is only called if two or more MPs or Senators call
  for one. If only one MP or Senator calls for a division then their
  name may be recorded in the official record (the Hansard) but no
  division will occur.
%p
  In the House of Representatives, if there are four or less MPs
  on a side of the division then the division does not proceed and
  the Speaker declares the decision of the House immediately.
  However, the names of the MPs in the minority are recorded.
%p
  In the Senate, if there is only one Senator on a side of the
  division then the division does not proceed and the President
  declares the decision of the Senate immediately. However, the names
  of the lone Senator may be recorded.
