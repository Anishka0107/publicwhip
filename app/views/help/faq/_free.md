In contrast to a [rebel vote](#rebel), a free vote (also known as a [conscience vote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscience_vote)) occurs when MPs or Senators are not obliged to vote with their par
are rare. For example, between 1950 and 2007
[only 32 free votes](http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp20#_Toc221347466)
took place. More recently in 2012 and 2013, the legislation related to same sex marriage
[was decided by a free vote](/policies/1).

Note that we use the term free vote over the more common "conscience vote" as it is
a more accurate term. In a free vote people are freed from the party whip so they can better represent
the views of their electorates. Also, it's possible for there to be free votes that are not on
"matters of conscience".
