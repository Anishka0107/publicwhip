An MP or Senator rebels by voting against the
[party whip](http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/party-whip.html). This is known as
[crossing the floor](http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/crossing-the-floor.html) and rarely
occurs these days.

In contrast, a [conscience vote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscience_vote) (also known as a
free vote) occurs when MPs or Senators are not obliged to vote with their party. Conscience votes
are rare. For example, between 1950 and 2007
[only 32 conscience votes](http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp20#_Toc221347466)
took place. More recently in 2012 and 2013, the legislation related to same sex marriage
[was decided by conscience vote](/policies/1).
