An MP or Senator rebels by voting against the
[party whip](http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/party-whip.html). This is known as
[crossing the floor](http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/crossing-the-floor.html).

Labor party members are not allowed to rebel. In the Liberal party
backbenchers are officially allowed to rebel but this is becoming increasingly uncommon in practise.

In contrast, a free vote (also known as a [conscience vote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscience_vote)) occurs when MPs or Senators are not obliged to vote with their party. Free votes
are rare. For example, between 1950 and 2007
[only 32 free votes](http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp20#_Toc221347466)
took place. More recently in 2012 and 2013, the legislation related to same sex marriage
[was decided by a free vote](/policies/1).

Note that we use the term free vote over the more common "conscience vote" as it is
a more accurate term. In a free vote people are freed from the party whip so they can better represent
the views of their electorates. Also, it's possible for there to be free votes that are not on
"matters of conscience".
