"Attendance" figures record the politicians who vote in any given division.

There are several reasons why a politician may have low attendance figures. For example, they may
have abstained, have ministerial or other duties or they may be the speaker. Currently, the
Public Whip does not record if a member spoke in the debate but did not vote.
