  Public Whip is concerned with the voting patterns of
  politicians, which means it is limited to formal votes (known as
  divisions, see
  = succeed ")." do
    %a{:href => "#division"} What is a division?
  This
  is because politiciansâ€™ names and how they voted are only recorded
  in the official record of Parliament (known as the Hansard) when a
  division occurs.
%p
  Unfortunately, most decisions in Parliament are not made by
  division (see #{link_to "When does a division occur?", "#division-occur"})
  and so do not appear on this site.
