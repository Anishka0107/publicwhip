When you click on a link for a [division](/divisions), you will be taken to a summary that
will either contain an edited description of the division or text taken automatically from the
official record of Parliament (known as Hansard). In some cases, the summary will contain no text.

Currently, the divisions with edited summaries are those that are relevant to one of
the [Policies](/policies). See our [Research](/help/research) page to find out more about how the
summaries are edited.
