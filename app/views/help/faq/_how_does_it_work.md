Debate transcripts of the House of Representatives and the Senate are published online as
[Hansard](http://www.openaustralia.org/). Public Whip takes these records and compiles lists of
votes that you can access under [Divisions](/divisions). You can search through these votes using
our [search function](/) on the home page or you can browse the votes that are relevant to the
particular policy areas listed under [Policies](/policies) (for more on our policies, see
[What are Policies and how do they work?](#policies)).
