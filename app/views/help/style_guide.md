The Public Whip is for everyone. It should be easy for everyone to find out how their MP votes in Parliament.
Use this guide when you write new divisions, summaries, or to help improve content that is already there.
This will help you make everything you write at the Public Whip easy to read and understand.

## Use plain English
People don’t stop understanding text because it’s written clearly. People who have trouble reading English may not understand if you use difficult language. Research shows that people who read very well people also prefer plain English. It allows them to understand your content as quickly as possible.

## Don’t use long words, buzzwords, or jargon
Use easy or short words instead of long formal ones. Use ‘buy’ instead of ‘purchase’, ‘help’ instead of ‘assist’, ‘about’ instead of ‘approximately’ and ‘like’ instead of ‘such as’.
Government ‘buzzwords’ and jargon are often vague, and don’t help people understand what is being said. The Plain English Campaign have a list of words you can use instead. This list is helpful to give you a sense of words which are easier to understand.

## Active voice
Use the active rather than passive voice. Use "They sang songs"(active) not "songs were sung" (passive)

## Avoid duplication
Duplicate content confuses people and damages the credibility of Public Whip content.
If something is written once and links to relevant resources easily and well, people are more likely to trust the content.

## Be concise
To keep content understandable, concise and relevant, it should be:
* specific
* informative
* clear
* concise (friendliness can lead to a lack of precision and unnecessary words) human (not a faceless machine)
* serious but not pompous
* emotionless – adjectives can be subjective and make the text sound more emotive and like spin
* non partisan - only use words which is used by one

## You should:

* use contractions (eg can’t, don’t, they'll, we've, let's )
* not let caveats dictate unwieldy grammar – eg say ‘You can’ rather than ‘You may be able to’
* not use long sentences – check any sentences with more than 25 words to see if you can split them to make them clearer
(Note: words ending in ‘–ion’ and ‘–ment’ tend to make sentences longer and more complicated than they need to be.)

## Use gender-neutral text
Make sure text is gender neutral wherever possible. Use ‘them’, ‘their’, ‘they’ etc.

## Stick to the style guide
By keeping to the style guide, we:
save time – people don’t have to learn different conventions
make fewer small mistakes
will make it easier for new people to start writing
help users  – some people will pick up inconsistencies while reading; that means they are thinking about how something is being said and not what is being said
raise trust levels – if we are consistent, we are giving a coherent view.

## Write for the web
We take into account how people read on the web when we write for Public Whip. We structure what we write so it can easily be read on-screen and accessed by all, regardless of age and background.

Anyone can put information online, but writing well for the web is very different. Look at popular information sites like the The Guardian, Oxfam or Lonely Planet or the BBC. You'll see their content is easy to read and understand.
They use:
* short sentences
* subheaded sections
* plain english. This helps people find what they need quickly and absorb it effortlessly.

## Know how people read
Knowing how people read means you'll write in a way they can understand easily and quickly.
By the time the average child is 9 years old, they can skip up to 30% of words on a page and still accurately predict the text. That's not just reading online. If there's enough context, the mind fills in the gaps. You don't need to read every word to understand what is written.
Also, online, people don't read in the traditional way. They don't necessarily read top to bottom or even from word to word.

## Use front-loadings
Web-user eye-tracking studies show that people tend to ‘read’ a webpage in an ‘F’ shape pattern. They look across the top, then down the side, reading further across when they find what they need.
So ‘front-load’ sub-headings, titles and bullet points. What this means is: put the the most important information first.
For example, say ‘Canteen menu’, not ‘What’s on the menu at the canteen today?’
Make sure your bullet points are all in the same tense and verb form, with any common information in the preceding sentence.

Good example:

At the activity centre you can:
* swim
* play
* run

Bad example:

At the activity centre:
* you can swim
* you can play
* you can run

## Use common words
By the time a child is 5 or 6 years old, they'll use 2,500 to 5,000 common words. Even as adults, we find these words easier to recognise and understand.
When you use a longer word (8 or 9 letters), people are more likely to skip shorter words that follow it, words of 3, 4 or 5 letters. So if you use longer, more complicated words, readers will skip more. Keep it simple.
Look at this sentence: "The recently implemented categorical standardisation procedure on waste oil should not be applied before 1 January 2014." It’s just an example, but you can imagine people missing that ‘not’. This is a big deal.
How about:
"Do not use the new waste oil standards before 1 January 2014."

Focus on the child’s common word set of up to 5,000 words. This makes it easier to read and understand information quickly.

Explain any unusual terms and keep a friendly, informative tone. It’s not a magazine and we won’t be using slang etc but keep the language easy to understand.
Remember that puns or wordplay can make the content difficult to find.
