<div class="container"><h1>Make a new policy</h1>
<p>
Here you have to name and describe the policy. Afterwards, you
will be able to select which votes support the policy. The new
policy can represent anything you like. Some examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Equal laws for heterosexuals and homosexuals.</li>
<li>For offshore processing of arrivals by boat.</li>
<li>Pro-nuclear power.</li>
</ul>
<p>
All policies are public. Just because you made a policy does not
mean you own it. Anybody can edit it. Although everyone will by no
means agree with every policy, they should agree that its votes in
divisions are logical consequences of its definition.
</p>
<p>Some other things to note about policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Policies should be open to as little interpretation as
possible. For example, "Evangelical Christian" and "Fiscal
Responsibility" are not policies since there are differing opinions
about what would be implemented. Instead, things like "Ban research
using embryos" and "Buy more nuclear weapons" are policies because,
even if you don't agree with them, you can still agree on which way
they would vote.
</li>
<li>
Usually a policy can't be broken down into other policies. If
it can be, maybe you should split it into two sub-policies. There
are exceptions, for example "Pro-vegetarianism" may agree with all
the votes for "Conserve coastal fish stocks" although for quite
different reasons.
</li>
<li>
The opposite of a policy is not necessarily a policy,
particularly if it is not one of the extremes. There could be, for
instance, three different approaches to solving a particular
problem.
</li>
<!-- TODO: Provide a specific Australian example -->
<li>
All policies must be convertable into votes. So, for example,
"Make Australia a Republic" doesn't work because there haven't been
any such votes (recently).
</li>
<li>
Don't be shy. These policies belong to everyone. If you have a
point of view that a policy is wrongly voting, or it's ill-defined,
or you can see how it should be broken down, discuss it with others
and fix it.
</li>
