Party politics
--------------

Table of most rebellious by party - so see most rebellious Con and LDem.
At the moment only Labour show up.
Table of highest attendance by party - similarly.

Compare attendance rates between parties, as they go in and out of
government over the years  (use raw data "Extra Turnout" uses)
Compare rebellion rates between parties

Find out must rebellious divisions by party
    e.g. find out what issues are fracturing the Tories

Statistics by party - e.g. attendence rate. 
How rebellious a party it is. etc.

Proportion of abstentions within each party, may reveal times when MPs abstain in protest.  

Amusing tables
--------------

MPs who shouldn't be in their party

% of completely pliant MPs, who always follow whip.

Table of members who died, who changed party etc.

Table of all MPs which have never voted - interesting to see
    what reasons there are (speaker, refuse to take oath, dead, lazy...)

Tables of worst attendance record (after those with an excuse, such as
ministry posts, speaker, ill, SF...)

"Performance tests" for government - turning excessive monitoring and
testing back onto them.
corruptometer, loyaltometer, evilness, sleepometer, waffle-meter

Data anlaysis (using existing data)
-------------

Chris Lighthead:  "I've now written some code to estimate which of the
eigenvectors are significant. The basic idea is that we generate
synthetic data using the marginal  distributions for each statements --
that is, like the data which would have been produced by the same number
of respondents as have completed the real survey, but  as if their
answers to any one question were unrelated to all the others; and having
done that, we perform the principal components analysis on the synthetic
data. The idea here is that we can compare the eigenvalues from the
synthetic data to the eigenvalues from the real data. If the real
eigenvalue is significantly larger than the one from the synthetic data,
it likely represents real variation in the data; otherwise, random
variation." - we could do this with MP clustering.

Improve clustering distance algorithm
    See J Vaughan suggestions

Colour dots in cluster diagram by how many times they have voted.
Bright colours for more relevant the data - i.e. how many intersections
with other's votes there are.

Find a metric to see if this is the case.

Plot "Extra Turnout" over time - so can see how abstention rates change.
Use abstention rates to highlight interesting divisions, where lots of
people didnt turn up.
Pick divisions with extreme "Extra Turnouts" (for the main parties) -
these will be interesting

Consider rebellions as % of available divisions, rather than % of
divisions the MP went to.  This is a different measure, is it useful?

Graph of how many MPs defect in each vote over time
Watch for loyalty going down after start of term, to lowest at midterm,
then up again

Rebels who voted against this division, also voted against this division...
Suspected friends - these MPs also rebelled like this MP
(fixing existing Possible Friends to use raw metric, rather than 
the cluster diagram positions)

List in public divisions where the teller/clerk messed up with spelling.
Why did this happen?

Find three line whip definition
Infer no Whip if 10% +- from base?  Or at least +-1

Animated cluster diagram over last 15 years.
3 month window moving week by week

Additional numeric data
-----------------------

Find "Motion made, and Question proposed," and "Question put and agreed
to." when there was no division.  Record these "virtual divisions" as
divisions, as they are really, just they were totally uncontested for
whatever reason.  Count them up and see where and how many there are,
whether there are more near bedtime etc.

Put time of division, so can work out importance (late at night less
governmental)
Also length of debate leading up to division
Intended length of debate

It is worth looking for MPs who spoke but did not vote.  This is a good
way to detect active abstentions.  It may also have all sorts of other
interesting meanings.
division.php?date=2003-06-10&number=224&showall=yes
Count how many times MP spoke in a debate, or on the day

Integrate parliamentary majority, and look for correlations with
rebelliousness?  Majorities here:
    http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/mps.htm
(Should be no correlation, as reselection more important?)
Plot majority as a colour on the cluster diagram

Analyse if MPs who are "sir" vote differently in anyway
    first check data integrity that title always has "Sir" for knights
Similarly, get data on gender etc. and analyse against that

Count who tellers are - does this mean anything?
Note they are often not listed in Hansard, so this might be a fools errand

What can we learn from the information that aye/noe comes first, and
    from the information as to whether government or not government is
    aye or noe?

How many articles do Labour MPs supply to the Times, for example?
Collate all MPs articles in newspapers

Regional analysis.  Scotland, NI, Whales, North v South.  Urban v.
Rural.  

Area of land for constituency.  This gives a "ruralness" measure.
Population of constituency.

Make cluster diagram for just divisions relating to one issue.  Or
for one person's interested issues.  Plot point on cluster diagram for
issues themselves.

Value of the vote.  What is the monetary expenditure cost of agreeing
the motion?  Graph against time spent discussing, and see how silly the
correlation is.

Measure lobbying power behind each issue (expenditure by interested
parties).  Again, correlate to time spent on it.

Additional text content
-----------------------

Hansard search and browser.
- Decent search engine of structure data (database by MP who said what when)
- Highlight MPs names, with their party, how they voted in this
  division, if they rebelled, links to their details page etc.

Written answers.

Issue sub-selector.  User can log in, name an issue, and say which way
votes should have gone to satisfy him on that issue.  Get all manner of
people to make issues for next general election.

Software to follow legislation from Queen's speech

Group votes by department, so you can see areas of interest (Sirius
Gibson, Oxfam)

Put in EDMs, so can see who supports an EDM and follows it through to
actual vote (Sirius Gibson, Oxfam)
http://edm.ais.co.uk/

Analyse an MP's interests by their rebellions - work out a summary of
their special interests.  Also link to which debates they spoke in.

Committees, and voting in committee

Usability
---------

Email reports to people when search queries change
e.g. When your MP has voted.  When he has rebelled.  When an issue is
voted on, and so on.

Show majority in division table - sort by which ones majority was least on?

Link from MP to other sources of info 
    - Ask Aristotle
    - Fax your MP
    - Speeches on Hansard
Link from search engine to
    - link to search Hansard?

Links to other political resource websites

hansard.php - takes links to days and chunks, does a redirect
reduce bandwidth, and do tracking of where people link through to

Log failed searches so we can improve the search engine

Detect MS Java applet and upgrade it
FastCGI if our load gets high
mod_gzip to reduce bandwidth

Paragraph text should always be wrapped with a max width, so it is
readable on very wide browsers. (Giles)

Usability (some sort of done - this is just some notes)
    - make website name link back to homepage
    - consider link titles http://www.useit.com/alertbox/980111.html
    - about the authors, so feels personal to people
    - consider breadcrumb trail
    - about section (not all FAQ?)
    - company name/logo at topleft, search at topright
    - search input box on front page (http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20010513.html)
    - print stylesheet media="print" removing menus

Physicsl gimmicks
-----------------

Actually post a whipping sheet to MPs.  This would arrive every week at
the same time as their party whipping sheet.  It would tell them how
many voters in their constituency have register with organisations which
would like them to vote particular ways.

Make big wall chart of cluster diagram - colour, pretty
Maybe even sell it to people

<< The Official Report (Hansard) is an edited verbatim report of
proceedings in the Chamber, in Westminster Hall and in Standing
Committees. MPs' words are reported with repetitions and redundancies
omitted and with obvious mistakes corrected, but nothing is left out

It was first produced by Thomas Curson Hansard  as a private commercial

Story leads
-----------

Mersey Tunnels, the rebellion appears to be local to merseyside, in
which case you have the national MPs voting and possibly overruling on a
local issue which maybe many of them don't give a damn, but just want to
prove their loyalty.
http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2003-06-10&number=225
Note the MPs who were at the debate, but abstained (like Miller)
Many constituencies have word "Liverpool" in their name, see how they
behaved with regard to this vote.

Similar constituency, but joined by habit.  Are these all smokers?
http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2003-04-14&number=162
And why were the parties voting on opposite sides at all?  Is this a
party issue, or just the way the system works?  Do what you're told if
you can't be bothered to think.  Going through the motions.  Aren't a
lot of divisions not present because people can't be bothered.  Foregone
conclusion.  Only will flush out rebels, which doesn't serve anyone's
interests.

Umm, where are the Tories?
http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2003-05-08&number=180
It's an amusing division, as so many Labour people rebelled, but Her
Majesty's Opposition didn't give a damn.

I spy strangers

Count the amount of parliamentary time wasted on hunting!  In hours,
minutes, words and even monetary cost.
http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/search.php?query=hunting&button=Search

Look for divisions where Scottish MPs vote on English only issues, and
see how honourable they are - do they not turn up?  Do they vote with
the whip?

e.g. Student Finance division 23 June 2003, div 244 - 10 Labour MPs voted in rebellion,
but a further 100 abstained.

Do Co-op members ever vote against Labour as a group?

Questions
---------

What makes a division just get waved through without a vote?  How is a
vote caused?
