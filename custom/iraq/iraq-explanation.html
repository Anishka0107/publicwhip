<h3>24 September 2002 - Iraq and Weapons of Mass Destruction</h3>

<p><b>The debate on the day the first 
dossier of <em>evidence</em> was published, 
for which parliament had been recalled: </b></p>

<p><b>Blair said: </b></p>

<p>[Saddam's] weapons of mass destruction programme is active, 
detailed and growing. The policy of containment is 
not working. The weapons of mass destruction programme 
is not shut down; it is up and running now. </p>

<p>The intelligence picture ... is extensive, detailed 
and authoritative. It concludes that Iraq has chemical 
and biological weapons ... which could be activated 
within 45 minutes, ...
and that he is actively trying to 
acquire nuclear weapons capability. 
</p>

<p>Saddam has bought or attempted to buy specialised 
vacuum pumps of the design needed for the gas 
centrifuge cascade to enrich uranium; 
an entire magnet production line of the specification 
for use in the motors and top bearings of gas centrifuges; 
dual-use products, such as anhydrous hydrogen fluoride 
and fluoride gas, which can be used both in 
petrochemicals but also in gas centrifuge cascades; 
a filament winding machine, which can be used to 
manufacture carbon fibre gas centrifuge rotors; 
and he has attempted, covertly, to acquire 
60,000 or more specialised aluminium tubes, 
which are subject to strict controls owing to 
their potential use in the construction of 
gas centrifuges.</p>


<p>[W]e know that Saddam has been trying to buy 
significant quantities of uranium from Africa... 
[O]f course, the weapons require ballistic missile 
capability... It is clear that a significant number 
of longer-range missiles were effectively concealed 
from the previous inspectors and remain, including 
up to 20 extended-range Scud missiles; 
that in mid-2001 there was a step change 
in the programme and, by this year, Iraq's 
development of weapons with a range of more 
than 1,000 km was well under way; and that 
hundreds of people are employed in that programme, 
facilities are being built and equipment procured -- 
usually clandestinely. 
</p>

<p><b>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) asked: </b></p>

<p>Has [The Prime Minister] given the United States any 
commitment that the United Kingdom would support 
unilateral action against Iraq?</p>

<p><b>The Prime Minister replied: </b></p>

<p>As I said a moment ago, we are not at the stage 
of taking decisions about military action. </p>

<p><b>It was a debate without a proper vote.  
Paul Flynn (Newport, West) made a point of order:</b></p>

<p>[M]y constituents -- and many of them have spoken to me -- 
will not understand why I cannot vote today against 
following the Bush agenda. </p>

<p><b>With nothing to vote on, except a procedural motion that 
the House should adjourn, the day eventually ended.  
Votes not to adjourn were cast by those opposed to the war 
(marked in column 1 by an empty circle), but the House adjourned anyway 
because after ten o'clock such decisions are void.  </b></p>
 
<hr>

<h3>25 November 2002 - UN Security Council Resolution 1441</h3>

<p><b>The House adopted the following motion: </b></p>

<p>"That this House supports UNSCR 1441 as unanimously 
adopted by the UN Security Council; agrees that 
the Government of Iraq must comply fully with all 
provisions of the Resolution; and agrees that, if it 
fails to do so, the Security Council should meet 
in order to consider the situation and the need 
for full compliance."</p>

<p><b>The MPs in marked in column 2 
rejected the following amendment: </b></p>

<p>Add to the end of the motion: 
"and believes that any decision that Iraq is 
in material breach of Resolution 1441 is 
for the UN Security Council as a whole 
to determine and that no military action 
to enforce Resolution 1441 should be taken 
against Iraq without a mandate from the UN 
Security Council; and further believes that no 
British forces should be committed to any such 
military action against Iraq without a debate 
in this House and a substantive motion in favour." </p>  

<p><b>During the debate, Mr. Neil Gerrard (Walthamstow), 
said: </b></p>

<p>I say to colleagues who are considering how to vote 
that I suspect they will not have a second chance. 
Please do not support the Government motion in the 
belief that, at some point, before any military action, 
there will be the opportunity to vote on that military action. 
I do not believe that they will have that opportunity. 
I ask every hon. Member to think about that before 
deciding how to vote. 
</p>

<p><b>But there were two further debating days 
in which the majority of members of the 
House chose again the path to war, 
in spite of massive public outrage, and 
routine unmasking of every single lie 
that was presented to justify the invasion</b></p>  

<hr>

<h3>January 2003</h3>

<p><b>A second dossier of evidence was published 
by the Prime Minister's office, using 
years out-of-date information plagarized from 
a Californian student's PhD thesis on the web.  </b></p>  

<p><b>Such was the low quality of this propaganda 
effort that it was dubbed the "dodgy dossier", 
apologies were offered, accepted, and the whole 
embarrassing episode has been forgotten 
as though it has never happened.  
</b></p>

<hr>

<h3>26 February 2003 - Iraq</h3>

<p><b>The House adopted the following motion, 
on the votes of the MPs marked in column 3: </b></p>

<p>"That this House takes note of Command Paper Cm5769 
on Iraq; reaffirms its endorsement of United Nations 
Security Council Resolution 1441, as expressed in 
its Resolution of 25th November 2002; supports the 
Government's continuing efforts in the United Nations 
to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction; 
and calls upon Iraq to recognise this as its final 
opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations."
</p>

<p><b>The members marked in column 4 rejected the following 
amendment to the motion: </b></p>

<p>To leave out from "destruction" to end and add: 
"but finds the case for military action against 
Iraq as yet unproven."
</p>

<p><b>During the debate, there was very little mention of 
the unprecedented marches around the world on February 15.  
Mr. George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) said: </b></p>

<p>I want to put on record that I support my Government -- 
not out of loyalty, although that is not a bad reason -- 
but because I think that they are right.  
[S]upporting the Government today does not 
mean that one is in favour of war ...
I do not doubt the sincerity of the majority 
of those who oppose Government policy, but ... 
I saw no placards 
on those marches saying, "Saddam must go". I 
saw no mention of the 2 million dead in the 
two wars.  </p>

<p><b>Simon Hughes (Southwark, North and Bermondsey) 
pointed out: </b></p>
 
<p>If the right hon. Gentleman reads the record, 
he will know that both sides of the House have 
condemned Saddam Hussein for years. Surely he 
understands that those of us who marched, and 
were proud to march, did so because we believe 
that when advisers to the Security Council 
say that they want more time and that they might 
be able to achieve disarmament if they had it, 
that is a road to disarmament by peace that must 
be preferable to a road to disarmament by war. </p>  


<p><b> Mr. Kenneth Clarke (Rushcliffe) said: </b></p>

<p>If war happens in the next few weeks hon. Members must 
ask themselves whether it is legitimate 
to believe that such action had already 
been determined and had been remorselessly 
unfolding for many months. Many people believe that. 
It is why middle England and those of moderate 
political opinions have so many doubts. 
To many of my constituents, the answer to the 
questions, "Did Washington determine such action 
many months ago?" </p>

<p><b>Mr. George Galloway (Glasgow, Kelvin) said: </b></p>

<p>This is a defining moment. For the first time in 
many years, Parliament has an opportunity truly 
to shape world events... [I]f this 
Parliament sends the message tonight that the British 
people are not with this adventure, it will have 
a decisive impact on opinion in the United States of America. 
We are always told that it is too early to vote 
on war until it is too late. This is our last 
opportunity meaningfully to affect the course of 
these great events, and hon. Members are 
fooling themselves if they do not acknowledge that. 
We all know what the public want... 
</p>  
 
<p>This debate is about one man ... George W. Bush... 
This is an American presidency 
that people on the Labour Benches would not 
have been seen dead with. 
This is an Administration ... who broke all 
the international treaties, who walked away 
from every international effort held dear by 
Labour Members. </p>

<p><b>But our <em>democratically accountable</em> 
Members of Parliament were given one more chance 
to pull the rug from under this operation 
before it commenced.  </b></p>

<hr>

<h3>18 March 2003 - Iraq</h3>

<p><b>Two days before the night-time bombing of Baghdad 
in an operation called "Shock and Awe", the House once again 
debated the wisdom of this action, and once again its 
members failed to stop it.  The 
wordy motion was put and carried by the votes of the MPs 
in column 5: </b></p>

<p>That this House notes its decisions of 25th November 2002 
and 26th February 2003 to endorse UN Security Council 
Resolution 1441; // recognises that Iraq's weapons of 
mass destruction and long range missiles, and its 
continuing non-compliance with Security Council Resolutions, 
pose a threat to international peace and security; 
notes that in the 130 days since Resolution 1441 
was adopted Iraq has not co-operated actively, 
unconditionally and immediately with the weapons inspectors, 
and has rejected the final opportunity to comply and 
is in further material breach of its obligations 
under successive mandatory UN Security Council Resolutions; 
regrets that despite sustained diplomatic effort 
by Her Majesty's Government it has not proved possible 
to secure a second Resolution in the UN because 
one Permanent Member of the Security Council made 
plain in public its intention to use its veto whatever 
the circumstances; notes the opinion of the 
Attorney General that, Iraq having failed to comply 
and Iraq being at the time of Resolution 1441 
and continuing to be in material breach, 
the authority to use force under Resolution 678 
has revived and so continues today; believes that 
the United Kingdom must uphold the authority of 
the United Nations as set out in Resolution 1441 
and many Resolutions preceding it, and therefore 
supports the decision of Her Majesty's Government 
that the United Kingdom should use all means necessary 
to ensure the disarmament of Iraq's weapons of 
mass destruction; offers wholehearted support to 
the men and women of Her Majesty's Armed Forces 
now on duty in the Middle East; // in the event of 
military operations requires that, on an urgent basis, 
the United Kingdom should seek a new Security Council 
Resolution that would affirm Iraq's territorial integrity, 
ensure rapid delivery of humanitarian relief, 
allow for the earliest possible lifting of UN sanctions, 
an international reconstruction programme, 
and the use of all oil revenues for the benefit 
of the Iraqi people and endorse an appropriate 
post-conflict administration for Iraq, leading to a 
representative government which upholds human rights 
and the rule of law for all Iraqis; and also welcomes 
the imminent publication of the Quartet's roadmap 
as a significant step to bringing a just and 
lasting peace settlement between Israelis and 
Palestinians and for the wider Middle East region, 
and endorses the role of Her Majesty's Government 
in actively working for peace between 
Israel and Palestine.
</p>

<p><b>The members marked in column 6 had previously 
rejected the following amendment to the motion: </b></p>

<p>To replace the text between the  
"//" signs with: 
"believes that the case for war against Iraq has 
not yet been established, especially given the 
absence of specific United Nations authorisation; 
but, in the event that hostilities do commence, 
pledges its total support for the British forces 
engaged in the Middle East, expresses its admiration 
for their courage, skill and devotion to duty, 
and hopes that their tasks will be swiftly concluded 
with minimal casualties on all sides."
</p>

<p><b>During the debate, Mr. Alex Salmond (Banff and Buchan) 
said: </b></p>

<p>The ... French, 
Russians and Chinese always made it clear 
that they would oppose a second resolution 
that led automatically to war... 
A month ago, [the Prime Minister] said that the only 
circumstances in which he would go to war 
without a second resolution was if the 
inspectors concluded that there had been 
no more progress, which they have not; 
if there were a majority on the Security Council, 
which there is not; and if there were an 
unreasonable veto from one country, but there 
are three permanent members opposed to the 
Prime Minister's policy. 
</p>

<p><b>The leader of our <em>loyal</em> Opposition, 
Mr. Iain Duncan Smith (Chingford and Woodford Green), said: </b></p>
 
<p>Saddam Hussein has the means, the mentality and 
the motive to pose a direct threat to our national security. 
That is why we will be voting tonight to do 
the right thing by our troops and the British people. 
</p>

<p><b>Mr. Robert N. Wareing (Liverpool, West Derby)
intervened: </b></p>

<p>... [I]s the right hon. 
Gentleman aware that, between 1986 and 1991, 
12 early-day motions were tabled in this 
House calling for the abandonment of the supply 
of arms to Iraq and condemning what happened at 
Halabja, and that all the 60 Members who signed at 
least one of those motions 
were Labour Members? Not a single Tory name 
was included. 
[N]ot even the [current] Prime Minister signed any 
of them. 
</p>

<p><b>The speaker stopped him so that 
the leader of the opposition could continue 
his important speech: </b></p>

<p>Saddam Hussein has the means and the mentality. 
He also has the motive...
The threat that his arsenal poses to British citizens 
at home and abroad cannot simply be contained... 
[T]hose who doubt that... are living in cloud cuckoo land. 
</p>

<p><b>John McDonnell (Hayes and Harlington) said: </b></p>
 
<p>I would respect [the Prime Minister]  
more if he gave us a free vote instead of a 
three-line Whip.
</p>

<p>We cannot simply 
erase the US ambassador's commitment to UN 
Security Council partners that resolution 1441 
contained no hidden triggers and "no automaticity". 
</p>

<p>In the past 12 months, we have 
been treated to a global propaganda exercise 
to persuade us of the need to attack Iraq... 
Most people have seen through [it]... 
They have been 
offended by the use of the memories of those who 
died on 11 September to justify dusting off Rumsfeld's 
five-year-old plan to invade Iraq...
They have grown wary of pleas for and justification of 
war on humanitarian grounds by those whose humanitarian 
credentials are compromised by their military, economic 
and political support for the tyrant Hussein and who, 
after 20 years, have suddenly discovered the plight 
of the Iraqi people.
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>The bombing commenced on the night of March 19, 2003.  
There were spontaneous nationwide protests all through the day 
on March 20 as citizens blocked roads in major cities 
to express disgust at being ignored by their democratic 
representatives' remorseless march to war.  </b></p>

<p><b>So far, and it looks permanent, 
not a single "Weapon of Mass Destruction" 
has been found.  Every claim made about their existence was known 
to be false at the time of the invasion.  
The unfolding events have demonstrated a severe 
failure of governance and accountability to the 
people, and to the real world, of a scale not seen 
for decades.  </b></p>

<hr>

<h3>4 June 2003 - Where are the weapons?</h3>

<p><b>A motion was put to the House which stated the 
following: </b></p>

<p>"That this House recalls the Prime Minister's 
assertion that Iraq possessed weapons of mass 
destruction capable of being used at 45 minutes' 
notice; further recalls the Government's contention 
that these weapons posed an imminent danger to 
the United Kingdom and its forces; notes that to 
date no such weapons have been found; and calls 
for an independent inquiry into the handling of 
the intelligence received, its assessment and the 
decisions made by ministers based upon it."
</p>

<p><b>Jack Straw tabled the following amendment to the motion, 
which was adopted on account of the votes of the MPs marked 
in column 7: </b></p>
 
<p>Leave out from "House" to the end of the Question, 
and to add instead thereof:
"believes that the Intelligence and Security Committee 
established by Parliament is the appropriate body 
to carry out any inquiry into intelligence relating 
to Iraq; and notes in relation to Iraq's disarmament 
obligations the terms of United Nations Security 
Council Resolution 1483."
</p>



<p><b> Mr. Michael Portillo (Kensington and Chelsea) asked: </b></p>

<p>When the Prime Minister submitted a draft of the foreword, 
including the 45-minute point within it, did any intelligence 
officers remonstrate with the Prime Minister, 
or any other Minister, to say that they did not believe 
it should stand in the foreword because it was based 
on only a single source? If the answer is no, 
we can all move on.</p>

<p><b>The Foreign secretary, Mr. Straw replied: </b></p>

<p>The answer is no, and we can all move on. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Robin Cook (Livingston) asked: </b></p>

<p>May I return for a moment to the question 
of the 45-minute readiness of weapons of mass 
destruction? For me, the central question is not 
whether there was one source or two, or whether 
it was in the first or the second draft. 
The central point, as we can plainly see now 
that we are in Iraq, is that that statement was wrong. 
Has the Foreign Secretary noticed that General 
Conway, commander of the US Marine Corps in Iraq, 
has said, after inspecting
every ammunition dump and having failed to 
find a single chemical shell, that we simply were wrong. 
If the US Marine Corps can say we were wrong, 
why cannot we?
</p>

<p><b>After one round of evading, Mr. Straw said: </b></p>

<p>I do not accept that, because we have not yet 
been able to find physical evidence of the 
possession of such weapons, those weapons 
therefore did not exist. That flies in the face 
of all the other evidence. </p>

<p><b>Clare Short, during her speech, said: </b></p>

<p>Three very senior figures in Whitehall said to me 
that the Prime Minister had agreed in the summer to 
the date of 15 February for military action, and 
that that was later extended to mid-March. 
At the time, the Prime Minister was telling us that 
he was committed to a second resolution, and 
I preferred at that time to believe the Prime Minister. 
From reflecting, reading and examining everything 
that was done, I now believe that the evidence 
is overwhelming that there was a date. 
That is why the Blix process was not allowed 
to be completed. We acted according to a date, 
not to deal with the fundamental problem. 
</p>


<hr>

<h3>17 July 2003 - The Select Committee reports</h3>

<p><b>A motion was put to the House which stated the 
following: </b></p>

<p>"That this House welcomes the Ninth Report from 
the Foreign Affairs Committee on the Decision 
to go to war in Iraq, Session 2002-03, HC 813; 
but notes some reservations by Committee members 
that it not only had insufficient time but 
insufficient access to crucial documents to 
come to comprehensive and definitive conclusions 
on some of the issues; further notes the recent 
concerns raised over intelligence material; and 
calls on the Government to set up a judicial 
inquiry finally to establish the facts of 
the matter."  
</p>

<p><b>An amendment was made to the motion, carried by the 
votes of the members marked in column 8, which read: </b></p>

<p>Leave out from "House" to the end of the Question, 
and to add instead thereof: 
"welcomes the Ninth Report of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee on the Decision to go to War in Iraq, 
Session 2002-03, HC 813; notes that substantial 
oral and written evidence, by and on behalf 
of the Government, was provided to the Committee; 
believes that the Intelligence and Security Committee, 
established by Parliament by statute, 
is the appropriate body to consider the 
intelligence relating to Iraq; and notes 
that this Committee has already begun its inquiry."
</p>

      
<p><b>Mr. Michael Ancram (Devizes), who tabled 
the original motion, said: </b></p>

<p>Decisions of life 
and death can and must be taken only on the 
best information available. 
The House has no direct access to 
such intelligence but only what it is told by Ministers. 
If ... confidence is lacking or has been breached, 
the House cannot be responsibly asked to take 
on such grave matters.
</p>

<p><b>Donald Anderson (Swansea, East), said: </b></p>

<p>I am confident that the Government believed 
that there was a real threat of the Iraqi 
regime using weapons of mass destruction. 
What other reason could one give for the issuing 
of protective anti-chemical warfare uniforms to 
our troops? It would require a conspiratorial 
mind of great magnitude to imagine that our 
Government would have gone through the charade 
of equipping our forces in that way if they 
did not believe that the threat was real. 
</p>

<p><b>Richard Younger-Ross (Teignbridge) said:</b></p>

<p>The MOD gave Challenger 2 tanks sufficient 
chemicals for the detectors to run for only six hours. 
Does that reinforce the right hon. Gentleman's point? 
Were we selling our troops short, or were some 
people in the MOD not taking the threat 
seriously enough? 
</p>

<p><b>Sir John Stanley (Tonbridge and Malling) said:</b></p>

<p>Yesterday, and again today, the Foreign Secretary 
made what I considered an extraordinary statement, 
suggesting that the Government did not consider 
the intelligence assessment that was made before 
the war in Iraq to be central to the issue of 
whether we should go to war... For a great many of us who voted on 18 March, 
the intelligence assessments were not part of 
the background at all; they were absolutely part 
of the foreground -- part of the heart of the matter.
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>The summer recess began.  Dr Kelly committed 
suicide, 
the Hutton Inquiry was established under the narrow 
terms that it investigate the circumstances 
surrounding his decision to kill himself.  </b></p>

<p><b>So far there has been no official public 
investigation into the decision to slaughter thousands 
of people in a foreign land who posed no 
threat whatsoever to the nation.  </b></p>

<p><b>But it's not necessary.  The table of those British 
nationals, our democratic representatives in government, 
who could have brought this to a halt at any time 
by the simple act of collectively walking through 
a door which said "Noe", is listed below.</b></p>

<h3>10 September 2003 - The Role of the United Nations</h3>

<p><b>After the disastrous first summer of the US-UK 
occupation of Iraq (deemed a success by nobody in 
the world but the high-ranking officials of the 
occupying powers, and their employees) 
a motion was put to the House which stated the 
following: </b></p>

<p>"That this House welcomes the publication of 
the recent draft resolution of the United Nations 
Security Council on Iraq; calls upon Her Majesty's 
Government to honour the Prime Minister's 
commitment to give the United Nations a vital 
role in the political and economic reconstruction 
of Iraq through a new Security Council Resolution 
which would expedite the restoration of sovereignty 
and democratic control to the Iraqi people, 
place the process of political transition under 
the auspices of the United Nations, transfer 
the whole responsibility for the economic reconstruction 
and rebuilding of Iraq to an Iraqi provisional 
government assisted as necessary by the 
United Nations and replace existing security arrangements 
with a multinational force under unified command 
obliged to report to the Security Council."
</p>

<p><b>As usual, rather than voting out the motion, 
the entire motion was changed by an <em>amendment</em>, 
carried by the votes of the MPs marked in column 9: </b></p>

<p>Leave out from "House" to the end of the Question, 
and to add instead thereof:
"supports the vital role played by the 
United Nations in Iraq as endorsed by 
UN Security Council Resolutions 1483 and 1500 (2003); 
pays tribute to the Secretary General's Special 
Representative, Sergio Vieira de Mello and his 
colleagues brutally murdered in the terrorist atrocity of 
19th August; welcomes the determination of the 
United Nations Secretary General to remain 
engaged in Iraq; further welcomes the initiation 
of discussions on a new UN Security Council 
Resolution on Iraq, which aims to reaffirm the 
United Nations' support for the work of the governing 
council, calls on the governing council to submit 
a timetable and programme for the drafting of a 
new constitution for Iraq and for the holding of 
democratic elections, proposes a United Nations-mandated 
multinational force under existing unified command 
arrangements and encourages UN Member States and 
international organisations to help the Iraqi 
people by providing resources for rehabilitation 
and reconstruction at next month's conference 
in Madrid."
</p>


<p><b>The Secretary of State for Foreign Adventures, Jack Straw, 
lied: </b></p>

<p>If Iraq failed to meet the conditions, 
1441 warned that "serious consequences" 
would follow. Diplomatic parlance is notoriously 
ambiguous, but that phrase was understood to 
have only one meaning -- military action... 
it was understood to be interchangeable

<p>In June this year the erstwhile Secretary of State 
for International Development admitted that 
"the preparations for post-conflict were poor 
and we have got the chaos and suffering that 
we have got now".
Those are the words of the person who had been 
responsible for producing a plan, and that began to 
fill me with suspicion that a plan might not 
have been made.

<p>I was last in Iraq in June...
On Monday, I mentioned a general who is the 
brother of an Iraqi friend of mine who lives in Wales. 
The general told his brother that he could get 
between 50 and 100 senior officers to act as 
liaison between the coalition and the Iraqi people. 
He had sent a message to Ambassador Bremer, but had not received 
a reply. 
</p>

<p>Last night, coalition forces -- the Americans -- burst 
into the house of the very general whom I mentioned on 
Monday, and all his family and his house were searched. 
I found it a curious coincidence that I mentioned that 
man on Monday and that his house was attacked last night. 
He is not the only one.

<p>When the Foreign Secretary talks about his 
genuine efforts to find a consensus on the second 
resolution, he omits to say that he was seeking 
a consensus on the way to engage in military conflict 
rather than a consensus on how effectively to 
disarm and deal with Iraq with the agreement of 
other members of the Security Council. 
</p>

<p><b>Dr. Jenny Tonge (Richmond Park) said: </b></p>

<p>Today, the Prime Minister referred to a "magnificent" 
victory in Iraq. Yesterday, the Under-Secretary of 
State for Defence, the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Caplin), 
was very upbeat about the situation. 
He certainly over-egged it...
He told us that reconstruction was taking place 
all over Iraq and that hospitals were open -- 
never mind what is going on inside them. 
He said that children were going to school, 
and that electricity and water were on tap...
Who was he kidding?

<p><b>The UN negotiations continue in New York, 
in an attempt to transfer the blame and expense 
to the international community, while maintaining 
control of the land and its mineral wealth.

<p><b>The Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, now 
maintains the self-contradictory position that 
the invasion of Iraq, against the will of the 
UN, was necessary to uphold the will of the UN.  
</b></p>

<p><b>The UN, flawed by design, is technically 
unable to censure the US and UK governments 
for wanton acts of international violence 
due to security council vetos held by the nations involved.  
This veto is far more important than the earlier supposed 
French veto against unconditional authority for an invasion 
without <em>sound</em> evidence of its necessity, 
because it means that, though the ongoing crimes of 
the US and UK are far more serious than 
the possession of chemical weapons by a defeated nation, 
the UN cannot indict them.
