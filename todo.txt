Do Iraq subselection ourselves
Do climate change subselection

Investigate EDMs, legality of using them

Look at majorities

Website
-------

Put news (at least headlines) on front page

Make cluster diagram clearer in "highlights" section on front page

Sort cluster diagram name entries by surname - rather than no order

Consider changing support@ email addr to something less corporate sounding

Trim some opinion waffle out of Cluster text

Newsletter
Some kind of comments system

Colour blind people, or indeed blind people, need a better rebel marker
than redness in MPs division list.  Boldness is one idea.

Scraper
-------

Check out tapiR, see if useful

Finish last few divisions that you don't have right
    Missing division 74

Check nobody existing voted when they were dead!
Check no constituency had two MPs at once

Check "Question accordingly..." fits with our counting
Tally vote numbers in text and check they fit with our counting

Deal with when an MP voted twice in one division
Search for MPs who voted on both sides in one division
Check for an MP voting both for and against!  See "Abstention" here:
http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/p09.pdf

Also I need to tidy the whole thing up to be more usable.  Reduce the
number of commands, make the pipeline more straightforward, and so it
doesn't go wrong if you do things in the wrong order.

Make one script I have to run which just does everything (backup logs,
backup sf cvs repository, get latest divisions, upload to db)

Improve motion text extraction
