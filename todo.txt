Investigate EDMs, legality of using them
Look for EDMs on parliament.uk (in daily papers)

Web site
--------

<h2> spacing on IE

Java in Opera Win32

Measure abstentions by parliament rather than global proportions?
MP page - print parliament in vote lists

Pass W3C validator
http://validator.w3.org/

Scraper
-------

Record tellers
Crosscheck lack of tellers with deferred division, should be one to one correspondence.

Make cluster stuff store NUMBER OF VOTES both voted in for extra possible friends info

Look at majorities

Check for repeate typo'ed constituencies
 - in "check" do a search for solitary ones

Garbage collection!

remake pw_mp to have left_reason entered_reason - make it error if you
don't make an entry using the reasons

Make one script I have to run which just does everything (backup logs,
backup sf cvs repository, get latest divisions, upload to db)

Also I need to tidy the whole thing up to be more usable.  Reduce the
number of commands, make the pipeline more straightforward, and so it
doesn't go wrong if you do things in the wrong order.

Check "Question accordingly..." fits with our counting
Tally vote numbers in text and check they fit with our counting

Search for divisions on days MP joined/left, as these could have
off-by-one errors for their changed party

Check SourceForge backup

Improve motion text / title extraction
    division.php?date=2003-02-03&number=74 - and div 73, detail missing
    division.php?date=2003-09-16&number=313 - too much text [interruption]
    division.php?date=2001-11-26&number=85 - excess interruption
    division.php?date=2002-02-06&number=158 - incomplete
    division.php?date=2003-09-10&number=307 - motion missed completely
    division.php?date=2001-01-22&number=71 - title is wrong!
    division.php?date=1997-07-07&number=42 - nothing of any use!
    division.php?date=2000-02-28&number=88 - too much text!
    division.php?date=2003-09-17&number=321 - not deferred division!
    division.php?date=2003-09-17&number=320 - not deferred division!
Add explanations
    division.php?date=2001-10-25&number=43 - multiple motions clearer,
also show initial motion in second vote, rather than hardly any text
