Scraper
-------

Resolve all the errors that "scraper.pl check" squirts out

Check for divisions which don't have quorum of 40

Measure abstentions by parliament rather than global proportions?

Make clustering cope with tellaye/tellno
Make cluster stuff store NUMBER OF VOTES both voted in for extra possible friends info

Look at majorities

remake pw_mp to have left_reason entered_reason - make it error if you
don't make an entry using the reasons

Make one script I have to run which just does everything (backup logs,
get latest divisions, upload to db)

Check "Question accordingly..." fits with our counting
Tally vote numbers in text and check they fit with our counting

Search for divisions on days MP joined/left, as these could have
off-by-one errors for their changed party

Improve motion text / title extraction
    division.php?date=2003-02-03&number=74 - and div 73, detail missing
    division.php?date=2003-09-16&number=313 - too much text [interruption]
    division.php?date=2001-11-26&number=85 - excess interruption
    division.php?date=2002-02-06&number=158 - incomplete
    division.php?date=2003-09-10&number=307 - motion missed completely
    division.php?date=2001-01-22&number=71 - title is wrong!
    division.php?date=1997-07-07&number=42 - nothing of any use!
    division.php?date=2000-02-28&number=88 - too much text!
    division.php?date=2003-09-17&number=321 - not deferred division!
    division.php?date=2003-09-17&number=320 - not deferred division!
Add explanations
    division.php?date=2001-10-25&number=43 - multiple motions clearer,
also show initial motion in second vote, rather than hardly any text

Campaigns
---------

Letter writing campaign by their constituents to MPs who use procedure
in an entirely negative way - for example here, when Labour maliciously
moved the house to sit in private, in order to stop the democratic
discussion of the role of ministerial advisers
