New stuff
---------

Facility to register and define voting subset for a particular issue
- info to help select which votes and which way should have voted
- SP adopters / constituency
- Auto email to adopters in each ward
- include journalism, so a comment on the issue / on each vote
- who made the issue is crucial, as some expertise is needed, and
  viewers of the site need to understand any bias that they have
- Report to take into your MP constituency surgery
- Let NGO entere postcodes of their supporters (in their own client app)
  and use these to find MPs where the most people agree with the issue,
  but the MP has voted the other way.

Garbage collection!

remake pw_mp to have left_reason entered_reason - make it error if you
don't make an entry using the reasons

Make one script I have to run which just does everything (backup logs,
backup sf cvs repository, get latest divisions, upload to db)

Also I need to tidy the whole thing up to be more usable.  Reduce the
number of commands, make the pipeline more straightforward, and so it
doesn't go wrong if you do things in the wrong order.

Check "Question accordingly..." fits with our counting
Tally vote numbers in text and check they fit with our counting

Search for divisions on days MP joined/left, as these could have
off-by-one errors for their changed party

Check SourceForge backup
