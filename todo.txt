Log file rotation
SourceForge backup

Some way of getting peoples names, making them permanent friends
    Mailing list?
    Forum?

Sort cluster diagram name entries by surname - rather than no order

Think more about excess motion text on bills

Consider changing support@ email addr to something less corporate sounding

Move distant metric stuff so it is uses the initial data, not the munged
data from the cluster diagram

Change our use of the word "rebel" more consistently

Trim some opinion waffle out of Cluster text

News/blog of observations we make about things
Some kind of news system
Some kind of comments system
Solicit help in some way?
Email address more prominant everywhere

Log failed searches so we can improve the search engine

Colour blind people, or indeed blind people, need a better rebel marker
than redness in MPs division list.  Boldness is one idea.

Log file grabbing for permanent keeps?

hansard.php - takes links to days and chunks, does a redirect
reduce bandwidth, and do tracking of where people link through to

Find logo

Detect MS Java applet and upgrade it

FastCGI if our load gets high
mod_gzip to reduce bandwidth

Usability (some sort of done - this is just some notes)
    - make website name link back to homepage
    - consider link titles http://www.useit.com/alertbox/980111.html
    - about the authors, so feels personal to people
    - license link violates by popping up new window - should be in main window
    - consider breadcrumb trail
    - about section (not all FAQ?)
    - company name/logo at topleft, search at topright
    - search input box on front page (http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20010513.html)
    - print stylesheet media="print" removing menus

Make big wall chart of cluster diagram - colour, pretty
Maybe even sell it to people

Play with stuff in vector search article
http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/02/19/engine.html
In particular PDL for speeding up octave algebra stuff

Scraper
-------

Finish last few divisions that you don't have right
    Gareth Thomas ambiguity
    Missing division 74

Check nobody existing voted when they were dead!
Check no constituency had two MPs at once

Check "Question accordingly..." fits with our counting
Tally vote numbers in text and check they fit with our counting

Deal with when an MP voted twice in one division

Also I need to tidy the whole thing up to be more usable.  Reduce the
number of commands, make the pipeline more straightforward, and so it
doesn't go wrong if you do things in the wrong order.
