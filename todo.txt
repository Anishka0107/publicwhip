New stuff
---------

Facility to register and define voting subset for a particular issue
- info to help select which votes and which way should have voted
- SP adopters / constituency
- Auto email to adopters in each ward
- include journalism, so a comment on the issue / on each vote
- who made the issue is crucial, as some expertise is needed, and
  viewers of the site need to understand any bias that they have
- Report to take into your MP constituency surgery
- Let NGO entere postcodes of their supporters (in their own client app)
  and use these to find MPs where the most people agree with the issue,
  but the MP has voted the other way.

Also I need to tidy the whole thing up to be more usable.  Reduce the
number of commands, make the pipeline more straightforward, and so it
doesn't go wrong if you do things in the wrong order.

Make one script I have to run which just does everything (backup logs,
backup sf cvs repository, get latest divisions, upload to db)

Improve motion text extraction
    division.php?date=2003-02-03&number=74 - and div 73, detail missing

    division.php?date=2001-11-26&number=85 - excess interruption
    division.php?date=2002-02-06&number=158 - incomplete
    division.php?date=2003-09-10&number=307 - motion missed completely
