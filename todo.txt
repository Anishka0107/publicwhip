New stuff
---------

Facility to register and define voting subset for a particular issue
- info to help select which votes and which way should have voted
- SP adopters / constituency
- Auto email to adopters in each ward
- include journalism, so a comment on the issue / on each vote
- who made the issue is crucial, as some expertise is needed, and
  viewers of the site need to understand any bias that they have
- Report to take into your MP constituency surgery
- Let NGO entere postcodes of their supporters (in their own client app)
  and use these to find MPs where the most people agree with the issue,
  but the MP has voted the other way.
Do Iraq subselection ourselves
Do climate change subselection

Investigate EDMs, legality of using them

Look at majorities

Scraper

Check out tapiR, see if useful

Check nobody existing voted when they were dead!
Check no constituency had two MPs at once

Check "Question accordingly..." fits with our counting
Tally vote numbers in text and check they fit with our counting

Deal with when an MP voted twice in one division
Search for MPs who voted on both sides in one division
Check for an MP voting both for and against!  See "Abstention" here:
http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/p09.pdf

Also I need to tidy the whole thing up to be more usable.  Reduce the
number of commands, make the pipeline more straightforward, and so it
doesn't go wrong if you do things in the wrong order.

Make one script I have to run which just does everything (backup logs,
backup sf cvs repository, get latest divisions, upload to db)

Improve motion text extraction
    division.php?date=2003-02-03&number=74 - and div 73, detail missing
    division.php?date=2003-09-16&number=313 - too much text [interruption]
    division.php?date=2001-11-26&number=85 - excess interruption
    division.php?date=2002-02-06&number=158 - incomplete
