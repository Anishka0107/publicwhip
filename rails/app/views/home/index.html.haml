    Every week, a dozen or so times, your MP votes on changes to Australian law. This is their definitive exercise of
    power on your behalf.
  %p In order to know whether your MP is representing your views on the issues, you need to know how they’ve voted.
  %p The Public Whip lets you see all their votes so you can hold them to account.
