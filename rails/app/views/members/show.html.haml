  Shows which Representatives voted most similarly to this one in
  the Parliament. This is measured from 0% agreement (never voted the
  same) to 100% (always voted the same). Only votes that both
  Representatives attended are counted. This may reveal relationships
  between Representatives that were previously unsuspected. Or it may
  be nonsense.
