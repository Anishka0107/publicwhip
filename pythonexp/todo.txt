findallhocdaydebate.py should die if date string empty

My content grabber does this (horrifyingly) early on:
    # remove strange hyphens
    $all_content =~ s/&#150;/-/g;
    $all_content =~ s/&#151;/-/g;

Make final output files called *.xml
    - Set correct content encoding at top of XML file (iso 8859?)
        (sgrep gives error UTF16 decoding errors)
    - Pass xmlwf
    - Pass a xsltproc conversion (entities)

Time stamp exception:
Time stamps aren't all being caught e.g. search for 1.27 pm in c2daydebatefixcolumnnumbers/daydebThursday13November2003.html
  this is a rare case outside of a heading.  explicit repair will be required.

(the "shelve" module looks quite sweet)
