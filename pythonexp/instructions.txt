Instructions

run findallhocdaydebate.py
	generates hocdaydebatelist.xml with a list of links (crashes at one point)

run gluehocdaydebate.py
	scans through hocdaydebatelist.xml and generates files of each glued day in gluedaydebates/
	the filenames are not acceptable; need to generate proper Japanese date formats.

run removelinebreaks.py
	scans through gluedaydebates/ and filters files to c1daydebateremovechars/ without their comments, badlinefeeds and internal links

[removecomments.py has been combined into the above case]

run fixdebatecolumnnumbers.py
	scans through c1daydebateremovechars/ converts columns and times, and writes into c2daydebatefixcolumnnumbers/



The loops through the directories need moving out of the files into a generic place
Next filters to do: the name identifications.
Breaking and identifying chunks.



cvs update -dP

cvs commit

cvs add filename

SLIPPERY POLITICIANS

As Michael Howard settles in to his new role as Conservative Party leader the tumultuous events demonstrated that a week is indeed a long time in politics. But Howard himself knows all too well that a simple question can also become an unnervingly long time in politics. The infamous 1997 exchange with Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight and others like it have become the subject of scientific study by psychologists who specialise in the conversational art of equivocation.

Entertainment aside it is key conversational exchanges like these which raise key psychological questions about high-status figures like politicians and the motivation that lies behind their preference for ambiguity and evasion. Is there something in their psychological makeup which forces or equips them to be so evasive?

Peter Bull is a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of York and he has studied in minute detail many hundreds of hours of tape of politicians being grilled for his recent book, The Microanalysis of Political Communication: Claptrap or Ambiguity.
