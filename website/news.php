Parliament has reconvened now summer is over.  However, under this new
system, after only two weeks it will adjourn for the party conferences. 
Yesterday there were <a href="search.php?query=water+bill&button=Search">three divisions
votes</a> on the Water Bill.  I'm doing these updates semi-manually at
the moment, so new divisions will only be available a few days after
they happen.
