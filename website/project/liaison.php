<p>The Public Whip puts the pages on the parliamentary website through
punishing tests, which immediately highlight small typing mistakes in
gigabytes of data.  It's rare that you'll notice an error with 
the human eye, but to us writing the software it appears that they are
everywhere.

<h2>Subproject Goals</h2>

<p>The Hansard Liaison Subproject aims to:

<ul>
<li>Track errors which cause material problems for the Public Whip
project.  For example, ambiguous or missing division listings.
Get these corrected on the Hansard website, or clarified so we can add
exceptions to our code.
<li>Work with the official record to improve the quality of their
website.  This includes standards compliant HTML,
consistency of data to aid computerised parsing, and ultimately
provision of information as XML or other structured data files.
<li>Persuade the official record to record the party whips at a division,
if it is clearly visible such as a member waving people into the right
lobby.
</ul>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p><a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=602722&group_id=87640&func=browse">Hansard
error tracker on Sourceforge</a>

<p>We are using standard bug tracking software to keep track of errors
in Hansard.  You can browse them using the link above.  Some of the
errors are "serious" which means there is a gap in the public record.
Others are just formatting errors which (sometimes massively) inconvenience us.

<p>We'd like people to help follow up errors with officers in parliament.
This work involves phoning up and finding the right person to deal with.
They will either correct the error on the website, or give us a
clarification.

<p>Dive right in, look at an item in the tracker on
Sourceforge, and chase it up!  Send me <a
href="mailto:francis@publicwhip.org.uk">an email</a> with any questions or
comments.

<h2>Baffled Outsider's Guide to the Parliamentary Bureaucracy</h2>

<p>House of Commons, Parliament, Hansard, The Stationary Office,
HMSO.  What are they?  What do they all do?  When you ring up part of
it you get to talk to incredibly helpful people.  Yet somehow you
still spend hours trailing round offices to find the one that is
responsible.  This baffling complex semi-privatised bureaucracy is still
a mystery to me, but I can shed a bit of light.  

<p><span class="ptitle">House of Commons Information Office (HCInfo)</span>.
The first port of call for anything.  These are
very friendly folk.  They seem used to the most peculiar of queries.
Best is to ring them up on 020 7219 4272.  

<p><span class="ptitle">House of Commons Library Help Desk</span>.
Another help desk, though more for internal use by parliament, whereas
HCInfo is for external use.  Their phone is 0207 219 2345.

<p><span class="ptitle">Information Architecture Support</span>.  If
you email <a
href="mailto:webmaster@parliament.uk">webmaster@parliament.uk</a> it
goes to this division of parliament.

<p><span class="ptitle">The Stationary Office (TSO)</span>.  
This privatised part of the old HMSO (Her Majesty's Stationary
Office) is based mainly in Norwich.   That such a basic democratic
service has been privatised is somewhat strange.  Their main
office for supplying books is 08457 023474.

<p><span class="ptitle">Parliamentary Press</span>.  An office
of TSO based in London.  Phone them on 0207 394 4255.

<p><span class="ptitle">HMSO Crown Copyright Office</span>. This
is the last remaining non-privatised part of HMSO, the rest is now
owned by TSO.  They deal with all crown and parliamentary copyright
issues.  Phone them on 01603 621000.
