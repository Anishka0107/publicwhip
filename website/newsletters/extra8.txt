Subject: Announcing Democracy Club - help beat political party propoganda

Want to help beat party propoganda at the next General Election?

Interested in joining with others in your constituency, to do simple
non-partisan tasks to help transparency?

Democracy Club is a new network of volunteers to do just that.

Your actions will help TheyWorkForYou (MP performance monitoring) and The
Straight Choice (live election leaflet monitoring) hold politicans to
account at the next General Election.

Please sign up now and tell your friends!

P.S. What you can also do *today*

If you have recently received any party electioneering literature at your home,
please upload it to the Straight Choice now. Then you can check back later in
the week to see if there are any other leaflets that have been going out in
your area.

We are also particularly interested in seeing local election campaign leaflets.

Sometimes politicians deliver different leaflets to different
neighbourhoods in their district in order to appeal to different sets
of voters.  This website will help you discover what your candidates
have been promising to your fellow citizens.
