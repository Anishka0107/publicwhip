The Public Whip ( http://www.publicwhip.org.uk ) is a project to
data-mine the voting records of Members of the United Kingdom
Parliament, so that you can hold them to account.

Editorial

Happy new session! Last week, the Queen's Speech marked the start of the
parliamentary new year. In the next few days we'll be able to celebrate
the division number rolling over to one again. 

Meanwhile, there's a brand new charity dedicated to making fresh
websites which, like Public Whip, use the internet to help society.
They're called http://www.mysociety.org . It's inspiring to read on
their website the ideas that they've collected. Now they're winnowing
them down to the perfect projects to actually fund.

Open Software, Open Standards - Feature Article 

When public affairs people first see the Public Whip they often ask how
it was made so quickly and efficiently. How can it exist when there is
no company backing it, or government funding it? It appears like magic
from thin air. 

Of course it isn't magic, just the tip of something new. There is a
large infrastructure behind it, invisible to most until now. This
infrastructure has only recently grown to the point where "civic
hacking" is possible. Yes, this is partly cheap PC hardware, and
increasing access to the internet. But it is also about the software,
and about standards.

Software is a special business because its product can be reproduced at 
almost no cost after it has been made. This is a natural property of
information, and one that the market is only just beginning to exploit.
Only art forms such as music are comparable, and as you may have read
that industry is going through massive upheaval. Software is too.

Most software that you've used probably relies on "intellectual
property" laws to make itself illegal to copy. This contradicts its
nature, but it allows people to invest capital in software, and build
their computer businesses. That is a dying way to run a software
company. 

The new way is to create some software that your business needs or that
your client pays you for. You then publish it and its blueprint ("source
code") on the internet for others to adapt, improve and use. This has no
cost to you, indeed you are already earning money from the savings the
software is making in your business. Software is a complex, effective
idea that is shared, like cooking recipes, available for everyone to
swap and improve upon. After all, this is how scientific progress is
made. Newton didn't patent his laws of gravity; he published his
equations so that later generations could improve upon them. In the
case of software you quickly get back for free the improvements which
others on the internet have made.

Public Whip relies on a sledge load of this "open source" software. I
can list the jargon names - Apache (a web server), Linux (an operating
system), Perl (a programming language), PHP (a website scripting
language), MySQL (a database), Octave (a statistics package) - but all
you need to know is that they are high quality tools for a computer
programmer. Of more interest to you for direct use are products like
Open Office (www.openoffice.org), a completely free suite much like
Microsoft Office.

So that's the first thing the mystified public affairs worker didn't
know - that "open source" software is now very very good. But all this
would be for nothing if the internet wasn't built on standards. It's
an old problem, which happened once before in the heat of the industrial
revolution.

In mid-nineteenth century Britain there was a crazy inefficiency. Every
factory and manufacturer had their own design of screw thread. This
meant that special custom fasteners often had to be made, and companies
couldn't exchange many tools and materials. An engineer, Sir Joseph
Whitworth, set out to solve the problem. He championed a standard
screw thread, which was taken up by many manufacturers, and eventually
adopted by the British Standards Institute.

The same thing happened at the end of the twentieth century with
information technology. In the early 1990s computer companies were
fighting each other to dominate the world with their own proprietary
networking system. If one had won, Public Whip would have been much
harder to do and so wouldn't have happened.

Luckily, sense was seen, and the Internet was adopted as a standard.
The Hansard web site is served using a globally agreed network protocol
(HTTP), and using a globally agreed file format (HTML). Just like the
standard screw threads, IT standards are incredibly enabling. As well
as letting data be used in flexible ways, they prevent vendor lock in,
improving market competition.

The battle isn't won yet, standards have to be constantly championed.
Take a look at the parliamentary live internet video broadcasts. You can
find them at http://www.parliamentlive.tv . They are broadcast only in
Windows Media Player format. This is a closed format, owned by
Microsoft, which nobody else can make software to create or play. On
a selfish note, this means that I can't view broadcasts of my democratic
representatives, as I happen to not use software made by Microsoft. But
there is a problem even for the majority who use Windows.

It means that nobody can ever make something like Public Whip for
parliamentary video. If the video was open, somebody could record it and
provide MP3 audio downloads of individual speeches. But that isn't
possible while the broadcasts are in a non standard format. A format
that can't screw into anything else.

So that's the second thing that has enabled Public Whip to appear as if
by magic. Open protocols and open formats untie the internet, and
ultimately make it much more useful.

Counting Tellers and Abstentions - Site Updates 

Public Whip now counts up "tellers". At each division two of these
creatures stand by each lobby and count the voters. This acts as a 
cross check to the clerks inside the lobby who write down a list
of names. Although formally it need not be, in practice it is always
the case that a teller supports the side that he tells for.

The tellers are listed in Hansard, but Public Whip wasn't counting them.
Now it does, and you will notice that everyone's attendance rate has
gone up slightly. The effect is particularly extreme for some party
whips, who tell very often. For example, Hugh Robertson's attendance
went from 64.3% to 72.4%. Thanks to everyone who asked for and helped us
add this feature - you know who you are.
http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?firstname=Hugh&lastname=Robertson&constituency=Faversham+%26+Mid+Kent

The occasions when an MP telled are now summarised in the same table
which lists when they rebelled. Sometimes an MP is both a rebel and a
teller, which is perhaps especially significant. Jeremy Corbyn, for
example, has done this on many occasions. 
http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?firstname=Jeremy&lastname=Corbyn&constituency=Islington+North

Confused about "boths", "abstains" or "tellers"? A side bar on the page
for each division now explains more clearly the terms used in the party
summary table. For example, see how much Labour MPs abstained in the
crucial Foundation Hospital vote, despite the heavy whipping. Indeed
David Taylor, a Lab/Co-op MP, actively abstained by voting both aye and
no.
