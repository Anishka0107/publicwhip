Subject: Help make the election more transparent! Public Whip 2010 Election Special #1
Date: Fri, 16 Apr 2010 11:32:57 +0100

Three sites which need your help for the next three weeks, to 
build archives of what happened during the election, and to hold
politicians to account.


1. The Straight Choice, live election leaflet monitoring project.
Please please, especially in interesting marginals, get leaflets
off friends and upload them here. This is our only chance not
to lose these leaflets forever.

http://www.thestraightchoice.org/

If you want the stories that are coming from it, follow @thec
on Twitter. If you're a journalist or blogger, email team@thestraightchoice.org
to get a daily press briefing.


2. Election Champion, election billboard game and archive.

Take photos of party adverts that you see, and upload them here. It's
also a game - you can be First Lord of the Treasury if you get more
than anyone else!

As well as being fun, this will turn into an invaluable record of how the
campaign was fought.


3. YourNextMP, basic data about candidates.

Please check out constituencies that you know, and fill in any missing
details. Photographs particularly appreciated!

This is being used by TheyWorkForYou for an election survey and quiz.
Make sure your future MP gets a good profile on TheyWorkForYou, by adding
them to YourNextMP properly now.


Finally, if you want to join a community to do more fun, simple tasks
to make a transparent, non-partisan difference to our politics, make
sure you are signed up to Democracy Club.
